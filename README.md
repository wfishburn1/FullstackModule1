**Architecture**
In this project, I utilized three main types of frontend development:
**Express HTML:** Used for rendering static HTML pages. This approach is straightforward and efficient for serving static content.
**JavaScript:** Employed for adding interactivity and dynamic content to the web pages. JavaScript is essential for client-side scripting and enhancing user experience.
Single-Page Application (SPA): Implemented using Angular. SPAs provide a seamless user experience by loading a single HTML page and dynamically updating content as the user interacts with the app.
Backend Development
The backend was built using Node.js and Express, with a NoSQL MongoDB database. The choice of MongoDB was driven by its flexibility in handling unstructured data and its scalability, which is ideal for applications with varying data structures and large volumes of data.

**Functionality**
**JSON vs JavaScript**
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. Unlike JavaScript, which is a programming language, JSON is purely a data format. JSON is used to transmit data between the frontend and backend, ensuring that both sides can easily interpret and manipulate the data.
**
Code Refactoring and Reusable UI Components**
Throughout the development process, I refactored code to improve functionality and efficiency. For example, I modularized the codebase by creating reusable UI components, which reduced redundancy and made the application easier to maintain and extend. Reusable components also enhance consistency across the application and speed up the development process.

**Testing
API Testing and Security**
Testing the application involved various methods for request and retrieval, particularly focusing on API endpoints. Ensuring the security of these endpoints was crucial, especially with the added layers of security for admin login. I used tools like Postman for API testing and implemented JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication. Understanding methods, endpoints, and security measures is vital for maintaining the integrity and reliability of a full stack application.

**Reflection
Professional Growth**
This course has significantly contributed to my professional development. I have learned and mastered several skills, including full stack development, secure authentication, and API testing. These skills have made me a more marketable candidate in the tech industry, equipping me with the knowledge and experience to tackle complex web development projects.
